                                My journey into the tech world began with a strong academic background, where I discovered my passion for data and statistics. 
                                To gain practical experience and explore opportunities in technology, I volunteered as a Project Research Assistant in the UK through Erasmus+ programs. 
                                This role allowed me to work on feasibility studies, digital tools, and project workflows, while collaborating with youth from diverse European cultures. 
                                It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that reinforced my determination to build a career in tech.
                              <br><br>
                                With this foundation, I transitioned into data science and machine learning, applying my skills to solve real-world problems across industries like healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. 
                                My academic research in healthcare provided me with deep domain knowledge, enabling me to address complex challenges through data-driven solutions. 
                                Over the past 3+ years, I have successfully delivered 20+ projects, combining technical skills in end-to-end machine learning workflows, 
                                Generative AI, chatbots, and large language models (LLMs) with a focus on practical, scalable, and impactful results.
                                <br><br>
                                I currently work remotely as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer on a freelance basis, delivering data science and AI/ML solutions across diverse projects. 
                                Alongside my professional work, I am studying for a BSc in IT and Computing at Richmond College London as my second degree, driven by my goal to gain academic expertise in the tech field. 
                                This combination of practical experience and academic learning reflects my commitment to continuous growth and development in this field.
                                <br><br>
                                In every project, I combine technical knowledge with a collaborative mindset, developed through years of working with global teams and adapting to diverse cultures and perspectives. 
                                I prioritise clear communication, thorough planning, and a commitment to delivering solutions that align with specific goals.
                                <br><br>
                                Outside of work, I enjoy learning new languages to connect with people from different backgrounds, staying active through sports, and exploring the latest advancements in AI and machine learning. 
                                These personal and professional experiences continuously shape my clear, collaborative, and data-driven approach to problem-solving.
                                <br><br>

                                My journey into the tech world began with a strong academic background, where I discovered my passion for data and statistics. 
                                To gain practical experience and explore opportunities in technology, I volunteered as a Project Research Assistant in the UK through Erasmus+ programs. 
                                This role allowed me to work on feasibility studies, digital tools, and project workflows, while collaborating with youth from diverse European cultures. 
                                It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that reinforced my determination to build a career in tech.
                                <br><br>
                                With this foundation, I transitioned into data science and machine learning, applying my skills to solve real-world problems across industries like healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. 
                                My academic research in healthcare provided me with deep domain knowledge, enabling me to address complex challenges through data-driven solutions. 
                                Over the past 2+ years, I have successfully delivered 20+ projects, combining technical skills in end-to-end machine learning workflows, 
                                Generative AI, chatbots, and large language models (LLMs) with a focus on practical, scalable, and impactful results.
                                <br><br>
                                I currently work remotely as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer on a freelance basis, delivering data science and AI/ML solutions across diverse projects. 
                                Alongside my professional work, I am also studying in IT and Computing at Richmond College London as my second degree to gain academic expertise in the tech field. 
                                Combining  practical experience with academic study reflects my commitment to continuous learning and growth in this field.
                                <br><br>
                                I prioritise clear communication, detailed planning, and a commitment to delivering solutions on time that align with specific business goals. 
                                Outside of work, I find joy in learning new languages, as it helps me connect with people and their cultures, staying active through sports, 
                                and exploring the latest advancements in AI and machine learning. 
                                These personal and professional interests continuously shape my clear, collaborative, and data-driven approach to problem-solving.
                                <br><br>
